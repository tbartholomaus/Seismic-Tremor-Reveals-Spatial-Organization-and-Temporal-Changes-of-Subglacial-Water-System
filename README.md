# Seismic-Tremor-Reveals-Spatial-Organization-and-Temporal-Changes-of-Subglacial-Water-System
The code used in the analysis of seismic data used in Vore et al.  in Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface. The scripts allow for the analysis of seismic signals using the method outlined in Park et al. (1987). This repository contains 11 scripts which rely on one another to run. See “Work Flow for Scripts.jpg” to see the order in which to run the scripts. UTCDateTime_funcs.py contains multiple functions which many of the scripts rely on (so be sure to download this into you working directory). SytheticWaveforms_ParkMethodTesting.py is a stand-alone script that allows for the testing of synthetic waveforms using the method outlined in Park et. al (1987).
